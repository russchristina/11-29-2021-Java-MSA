-- Properties of a Transaction: Our properties of a transaction describe what must be true about
-- a SQL transaction. SQL transactions are:
/*
 * Atomicity: "All or nothing"; all of the data will either be persisted or it won't
 * Consistency: All concurrent transactions must abide by the same DB constraints
 * Isolation: Assuming transactions are concurrent, the results of one transaction should not affect another transaction
 * Durability: All data that is committed is persisted
 */

/*
 * Honing in on Isolation: There are 4 isolation levels in SQL:
 * 
 * Read Uncomitted: BAD PRACTICE; allows for uncommitted data to be read during concurrent
 * 	transactions. Allows for "dirty reads".
 * 
 * Read Committed: prevents concurrent transactions from accessing data that is not yet
 * commited. Prevents "dirty reads" - reading uncommitted data.
 * 
 * Repeatable Reads: prevents concurrent transactions from modifying records that are being
 * used (e.g. selected, etc.). Prevents dirty reads and "non-repeatable reads".
 * 
 * Serializable: prevents concurrent transactions from modifying the number of records on a table
 * while its records are being accessed. Prevents "phantom reads" (and all of the other reads).
 */

-- Example of changing your isolation level; please never go below read committed. Note that
-- higher you go, the slower your transactions will be as higher levels place more read and
-- write locks on tables and records.
