/*
 * SQL stands for "Structured Query Language"; it has a specific syntax and keywords that you must
 * familiarize yourself with. That said, this syntax is simpler than the syntax you see for programming
 * languages.
 * 
 * We use SQL to manage databases (DBs) - create new tables, insert records into tables, delete records, update
 * records, etc.
 * 
 * SQL as a language is divided into multiple "sublanguages". The sublanguages denote which keywords are used
 * to complete certain types of tasks. The sublanguages are as follows:
 * 
 * DDL -> Data Definition Language (e.g. create table, alter table, drop table, etc.): Geared towards
 * 		  the creation and removal of entities (structures that will hold our data). How am I storing my
 * 		  data?
 * 
 * DML -> Data Manipulation Language (e.g. insert, update, delete, select): Geared towards creating
 * 		  records and modifying those records. What data am I inserting/deleting?
 * 
 * DQL -> Data Query Language (e.g. select): Geared towards reading records
 * 
 * TCL -> Transaction Control Language (e.g. begin transaction, commit, rollback, savepoint): Geared
 * 		  towards finalizing or reverting changes to our database.
 * 
 * DCL -> Data Control Language (e.g. revoke, grant, create user): Geared towards managing access to
 * 		  your DB.
 * 
 * The most basic SQL commands are geared towards table creation and the insertion and updating of
 * records. Having said that, we are going to first create some "tables". A table is a structure that
 * contains a collection of records (each record represented as a "row" on your table).
 * 
 * The syntax for dropping and creating a table is as follows.
 * 
 * PostgreSQL is a database management system (DBMS). In fact, it is considered a relational
 * database management system (RDBMS). A relational database management system allows us to
 * establish relationships between our tables (also called "entities"). These relations allow us
 * to preserve "referential integrity".
 * 
 * In order to create relationships between tables, we use "foreign keys". A foreign key is a column
 * whose value points to an existing record on another table. In fact, a foreign key must point
 * to an existing record on another table.
 * 
 * When we create relationships between tables, we describe them using "multiplicity". Examples of
 * multiplicities include:
 * 
 * Many-To-One/One-To-Many
 * One-To-One (e.g. A person and their social security number)
 * Many-To-Many (often modeled with a bridge/join table)

recipe_name varchar,
recipe_cookTimeInMinutes numeric check (recipe_cookTimeInMinutes > 0),
author_id numeric references author(author_id) --this is a foreign key that points to a column on another table
);

/*
 * To be proper, if we wish to add a new column to this table, we should alter it. Alter is a keyword
 * that is used to modify an existing table (among other things). You shouldn't just drop a table
 * to make a small modification to it.
