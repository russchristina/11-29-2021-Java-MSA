A method is required that takes an integer n, and creates a sequence based on the Fibonacci sequence.

It is only required to calculate the first n, I will make it print that out too.

A linked list is most likely the best option, the Fibonacci sequence creates a new node based
only on the previous node.
Therefore, only two values are needed at a time to extend the sequence, the newest number and the
number just before it.

n + (n - 1) = n + 1
where n is looking at row number

row 1
0 + (0) = 1 --- ignore the 0 element, use just 1
row 2
1 + 0 = 1
row 3
1 + 1 = 2
row 4
2 + 1 = 3
row 5
3 + 2 = 5
.
.
.
row n
n + n-1 = n+1


Testing Requirements

Fibonacci sequence generator
- Take in an integer and return the integer at the nth position
- Create a LinkedList of length equal to n
- Create a method that takes LinkedList of fib sequence, finds next value, adds it to LinkedList

Sequence printer
- Take linkedList, print out array
- Print in format for sequence, including the math needed
