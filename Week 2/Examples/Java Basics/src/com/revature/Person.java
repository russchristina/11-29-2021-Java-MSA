	 * You generally want to use a "constructor" which takes argument to make it easier
	 * to initialize all of the fields with some starting value. In fact, we've already
	 * been using a "constructor":
	 * 
	 * Person christina = new Person(); <-- Person() is the constructor.
	 * 
	 * This is a default constructor that Java provided for us because we didn't define
	 * our own constructor.
	 * 
	 * That said, it is good practice to define your own no-args constructor. The syntax
	 * for defining a constructor is as follows:
	 * 
	 * 1. The constructor cannot have a return type.
	 * 2. The constructor must match that of the class.
