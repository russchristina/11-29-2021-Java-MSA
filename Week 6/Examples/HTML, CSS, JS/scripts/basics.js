// JavaScript has several basic data types. These include:

//Function
//Undefined
//Null
//Boolean
//Object
//Number (used for ALL numeric values)
//String

// You can declare them with the following syntax. I've also left in the calls to "typeof" in order to show what the function returns for each reference.

var aNum = 89.87;
typeof(aNum);
'number'

var aBoolean = true
typeof(aBoolean)
'boolean'

//Note that you can use single or double quotes for strings
var aString = "a string"
typeof(aString)
'string'

var aNull = null
typeof(aNull)
'object'

var anUndefined;
typeof(anUndefined)
'undefined'

var anObject = {}
typeof(anObject)
'object'

function aFunc(){}
typeof(aFunc)
'function'

/*Note that you do not include types with reference variables in JS. This is a syntax error.*/
String aString = 'what are you doing?'
VM850:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier

/*JavaScript objects look like comma separated lists of key-value pairs.*/
var anObject = {prop1:'a string', prop2:45.6, prop3:false}

/*You access a value in the object by using its key like so:*/
anObject.prop1
'a string'

/*You can also add properties to an object on the fly:*/
anObject.prop4 = 89
anObject.anotherProp = 'yet another property'
anObject

/*DECLARING VARIABLES IN JAVASCRIPT

There are 3 keywords we can use to declare variables in JS:

1) var: bad practice; it allows for redeclaration of variables and hoisting. Hoisting entails moving a variable declaration to the top of its scope.

2) let: good practice; it prevents redeclaration of variables and prevents hoisting.

3) const: good practice; it prevents redeclaration of varabies, prevents hoisting, and prevents reassignment.*/

var badVariable = 'nope'
let goodVariable = 'yaaaaas'
const alsoGoodVariable = 'also yaaaaas'

/*OBJECT EQUALITY IN JAVASCRIPT

In JS, you can use either the == or === operator to compare values. The == operator only compares values and NOT data types. In order to do this, type coercion occurs in which a pseudo conversion of one of the values being compared occurs. The === operator compares values AND data types. As a result, using the === operator is considered best practice. */

let string1 = 'content'
let string2 = 'content'

//true as expected
string1 == string2
'true'


let number1 = 1
let stringOne = '1'

//true because of type coercion
number1 == stringOne
'true'

//false because it checks the data type as well
number1 === stringOne
'false'

/*HOISTING: 
Recall that hoisting moves a variable's declaration to the top of its scope, which makes the following code valid.*/

function weWantTheFunc(){
    console.log(aVariable)
    var aVariable = 7;
}

//This function is equivalent to the following:
function weWantTheFunc(){
    var avariable;
    console.log(aVariable)
    aVariable = 7;
}

// We can prevent hoisting by using the "let" keyword like so. This will throw an error if we reference a variable before it is declared:
function weWantTheFunc(){
    console.log(aVariable)
    let aVariable = 7;
}

/**Please note that there is shorter way of creating functions using ARROW FUNCTION notation. Note that this is an anonymous function that changes the binding of the "this" keyword. */

() => {console.log('i am an anonymous function')}

/** The "this" keyword in JavaScript is all about the context in which it is used. Used outside of a function, "this" refers to the Window object: */

console.log(this)

/**Used within the context of an object, "this" refers to the object itself: */

var myJsObject = {prop1:'this is property2', prop2:function aFunc(){console.log(this)}}
myJsObject.prop2()
Object { prop1: "this is property2", prop2: aFunc() }
​​
/**Note that if you use the arrow function notation, the binding of the "this" keyword changes. In the following function, "this" refers to the Window object rather than the created "myJsObject" because we have used arrow notation. */
var myJsObject = {prop1:'this is property2', prop2:() => {console.log(this)}}
myJsObject.prop2()
