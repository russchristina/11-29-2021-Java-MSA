<!-- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is NOT a programming language. It is a markup langauge that is used to define which elements are present on a webpage. This means that any paragraphs, images, charts, sections, headers, footers, etc. that you see on a webpage are there because of HTML. HTML is NOT pretty on its own; it is often accompanied by CSS. -->
