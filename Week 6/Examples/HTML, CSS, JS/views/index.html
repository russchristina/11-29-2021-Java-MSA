<!-- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is NOT a programming language. It is a markup langauge that is used to define which elements are present on a webpage. This means that any paragraphs, images, charts, sections, headers, footers, etc. that you see on a webpage are there because of HTML. HTML is NOT pretty on its own; it is often accompanied by CSS. -->

<!--HTML documents, like XML document, are written using tags. There should opening and closing tags for most elements. The "html" tags are the root tags of any HTML document; this means that everything should be contained within them.-->

    <head>
        <!--The head of an HTML document contains metadata about the document itself. For instance, you can specify what the character encoding for a document should be and reference style sheets that should be used to apply styles to elements on this page.-->

            <!-- We can use the div tag to div-ide the page into different sections. This just allows us to logically group certain elements together.-->
