> The goal of a coding challenge is to practice using the concepts you've learned about over the past couple of weeks. Though I am not "grading" this challenge as you are not students, I will be looking at your attempts, which should be pushed to the "Coding Challenge" directory on your Git branch. Please note that your answers don't have to be correct and that copying and pasting an answer from elsewhere does not help you as you will be required to solve these types of problems in front of an interviewer one day. In essence, if you cheat, you only cheat yourself.

# Instructions

1. Each challenge's solution should be contained within its own file within a Java project you have created. In other words, if there are 3 challenges, you should complete each challenge within its own file within one Java project.
2. Each solution should contain a Java comment which explains the steps you would take to solve the challenge if you were NOT writing Java code. In other words, detail your thought process for solving the problem in general as coding challenges are not about the code itself but about using a syntax to apply a solution to a real-world problem. In fact, it is helpful to detail the steps before you start writing the source code which solves the problem.
3. Your attempts should be pushed to the "Coding Challenge" directory on your Git branch. I will not assist with you this as this is a part of the challenge as you should be aiming to become more comfortable with Git. If you can't remember how to use a certain Git command, please refer to the recording from week one in which we discussed Git.

**NOTE**: If you wish to challenge yourself, you can write your solutions without the assistance of an IDE and then open the code in your IDE later. This is a great way of practicing your syntax as you are required to know the syntax of any programming language you're learning for a job interview.

## Challenge 1: Instantiation

Write a method that returns an instance of a class called "Puppy". You should create any classes that are mentioned if they need to be created to make the code compile.

## Challenge 2: Sum

Write a method that takes any number of integers and returns the sum of all of those integers.

## Challenge 3: Absolute Value

Write a method that returns the absolute value of the difference of any two integers.
