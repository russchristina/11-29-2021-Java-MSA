			 * 
			 * === Request Head ===
			 * - HTTP Version
			 * - Any Custom Headers that the client has added
			 * - HTTP Verb/Method (e.g. GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH, TRACE, HEAD, OPTIONS)
			 * 		These verbs have "conventional" uses:
			 * 		- GET: The client is requesting a resource from the server
			 * 		- POST: The client is sending data to the server (there's something in the request body)
			 * 		- DELETE: The client wishes to delete a representation of a resource/data
			 * 		- PUT: The client wishes to update a representation of a resource
			 * 		- PATCH: The client wishes to do a partial modification of a representation of a resource
			 * 		- TRACE: Performs a loop-back test on the way to the target resource
			 * 		- HEAD: Like a GET request, but the client is only requesting the response head without a body
			 * 		- OPTIONS: Describes the communication options for the target resource
			 * - Request URL
			 * 
			 * === Request Body ===
			 * - JSON
			 * - Or XML
			 * - HTML
			 * - Binary
			 * - Whatever the client wants to send
